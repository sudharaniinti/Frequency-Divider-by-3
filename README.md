# Frequency-Divider-by-3
A frequency divider is a module that reduces the frequency of a signal. 
In general, Counters can act as Frequency Dividers. 
We usually heard of dividing the frequency as F/(2^n) using n-bit Counter which requires n Flip-Flops. For example, F/2, F/4, F/8 and so on. 
So, What about dividing the frequency by 3? 
How many Flip Flops do we need to design a Frequency Divider that divides the input clock Frequency by 3?
